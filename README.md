# Analysis and results

The repository contains different folders for each of the 6 cities on which the analysis were performed. In each of them are present the different type of datasets needed for the implementation and the scripts to process such data and to make the optimization model.

Moreover, other important files are:

- [`Report_Oasis.pdf`](./Report_Oasis.pdf) contains the description of all the steps of the project and present the obtained results.
- [`webapp.py`](./webapp.py) contains the script to develop a webapp showing the results obtained in each city.
